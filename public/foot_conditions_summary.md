**Plantar Fasciitis**
Inflammation of the plantar fascia causing heel pain, especially in the morning or after periods of rest.

**Neuroma**
A painful condition, often between the 3rd and 4th toes, caused by thickened nerve tissue (Morton’s neuroma).

**Achilles Tendinitis**
Overuse injury of the Achilles tendon leading to posterior heel pain and swelling.

**Hallux Rigidus**
Arthritic stiffening of the big toe joint (1st MTP), limiting dorsiflexion and causing pain during toe-off.

**Metatarsalgia**
Forefoot pain centered around the metatarsal heads, usually caused by overload or dropped metatarsal arch.

**Pes Cavus**
High-arched foot deformity that creates lateral column pain and instability during gait.

**Flat Feet**
Loss of medial arch leading to overpronation, fatigue, and possible progression to tendon dysfunction.

**Posterior Tibial Tendon Dysfunction**
Progressive collapse of the arch due to posterior tibial tendon weakness, often causing medial pain and flatfoot.

**Diabetic Neuropathy**
Loss of protective sensation in the foot due to diabetes, increasing risk of ulceration and injury.

**Limb Length Discrepancy**
One leg is shorter than the other, often causing pelvic tilt, gait asymmetry, or low back pain.

**Heel Spur**
Bony outgrowth at the calcaneus often associated with plantar fasciitis and heel pain.

**Hallux Valgus**
Deformity of the 1st MTP joint with lateral deviation of the big toe and a prominent medial bunion.

**Tarsal Tunnel Syndrome**
Compression of the tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel causing burning, tingling, or numbness in the foot.

**Osteoarthritis Of The Ankle**
Degenerative joint disease of the ankle resulting in pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**
Autoimmune disease causing joint deformities and inflammation, particularly in the forefoot and midfoot.

**Calcaneal Apophysitis**
Heel pain in growing children caused by irritation of the growth plate at the calcaneus (Sever’s Disease).

**Foot Drop**
Neurological condition resulting in inability to dorsiflex the foot, causing gait issues like toe dragging.

**Balance Issues In Elderly**
Common in geriatric patients with proprioceptive decline, muscle weakness, or fall risk.

**Posterior Tibial Tendon Rupture**
Advanced failure of the posterior tibial tendon, often requiring bracing to stabilize the medial column.

**Pediatric Pronation**
Flexible flatfoot in children, often benign but may require control if symptomatic.

**Charcot Foot**
Collapse of midfoot architecture in neuropathic patients, often diabetic, requiring total contact support.

**Ankle Instability**
Recurrent ankle sprains or giving-way sensation, usually due to ligament laxity.

**Charcot Foot (Advanced)**
End-stage collapse with rocker-bottom deformity; requires immobilization with a custom AFO.

**Rheumatoid Arthritis With Ankle Deformity**
Destruction of the ankle joint with joint instability and pain requiring bracing.

**Severe Flatfoot**
Stage II-III acquired flatfoot due to PTTD or ligament laxity, often requiring bracing.

**Ankle Arthritis With Instability**
Combination of degenerative joint disease and ligament laxity, increasing fall risk.
